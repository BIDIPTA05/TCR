        <h1>About the Seven Sister States of India- North East</h1>
        <p>
          North East India comprises of seven states commonly known as the “Seven Sisters”. They are Arunachal Pradesh,
          Assam,
          Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland and Tripura.
          The North East is a true frontier region. It has over 2000 km of border with Bhutan, China, Myanmar and
          Bangladesh and
          is connected to the rest of India by a narrow 20 km wide corridor of land. One of the most ethically and
          linguistically
          diverse regions in Asia, each state has its distinct cultures and traditions.

          From times immemorial, India’s North East has been the meeting point of many communities, faiths and cultures.
          A place
          renowned for its magical beauty and bewildering diversity, North East India is the home for more than 166
          separate
          tribes speaking a wide range of languages. Some groups have migrated over the centuries from places as far as
          South East
          Asia; they retain their cultural traditions and values but are beginning to adapt to contemporary lifestyles.
          Its
          jungles are dense, its rivers powerful and rain, and thunderstorms sweep across the hills, valleys and plains
          during the
          annual monsoons.

          The lushness of its landscape, the range of communities and geographical and ecological diversity makes the
          North East
          quite different from other parts of the subcontinent. In winters, mist carpets the valleys but swirls around
          the
          traveller in hills during summer rains, thus creating an enchanting and romantic atmosphere. The region has
          borders with
          Myanmar Bhutan and Bangladesh.

          The festivals and celebrations in the North- eastern states of India are a colourful reflection of the people
          and their
          lives. Throughout the year, different people celebrate festivals with lot of fanfare in different ways, most
          of them
          centering around their modes of living and livelihood.

          North East India comprises of seven states commonly known as the “Seven Sisters”. They are Arunachal Pradesh,
          Assam,
          Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland and Tripura.

          Each state is a traveller’s paradise, with picturesque hills and green meadows which shelters thousand of
          species of
          flora and fauna. In addition, the states provide scope for angling, boating, rafting, trekking and hiking.
          Besides,
          there are a number of wild life sanctuaries and national parks where rare animals, birds and plants which will
          surely
          provide fascinating insight to the visitors.
